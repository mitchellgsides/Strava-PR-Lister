# Strava-PR-Lister
This app will allow users to find their power PRs based on Strava power data.

Step 1: Authenticate User with Strava (currently, there's a demo profile available)

Step 2: Wait for data to load, then click 'Show Data'

Step 3: Click each ride to open a brief summary of power records from that ride. Additionally, a graph showing the maximum power on the ride for multiple durations will show.

*Note: Interactive charts are a work in progress. Currently, they display the last ride (with power data) to be selected.
